# Hack

ðŸ‘€ [Demo]](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ericakfranz/font-i-like/blob/main/mono/hack/demo.html)

A typeface designed for source code
Hack is designed to be a workhorse typeface for source code. It has deep roots in the free, open source typeface community and expands upon the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects. The large x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design make it legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in the 8 - 14 range.
